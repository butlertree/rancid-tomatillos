# [Rancid Tomatillos](https://tenthwalker.github.io/rancid-tomatillos/)

### Abstract:
This application enables a user to view a collection of movie posters and view details about a movie (runtime, trailer, release date, and more) by clicking/tapping on their poster of choice. They can navigate back to the main view from the details page via a NavLink, or by utilizing the forward and back buttons on their browser. In case of user or server error, appropriate error messages are shown.

### Learning Goals:
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Receive and utilize data from an API
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Design a responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly website
- Practice refactoring to DRY up code and apply new learning
- Prioritize accessibility across multiple devices and access needs, passing both the Lighthouse (100%) and WAVE (0 errors) tool audits.

### App Installation Instructions:
1. To get this app running, navigate to [the project repo](https://github.com/tenthwalker/rancid-tomatillos) and clone it down from GitHub under the "<> Code" dropdown. 
2. Open it from your terminal or preferred CLI with `git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>`. 
3. Move (`cd`) into the directory. 
4. Use `npm install` inside the directory to get the necessary package manager. If you do not have Cypress on your machine for testing, detailed instructions for install can be found [in their docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Installing).
5. Open the file in your code editor of choice.
6. The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using `npm start` in your terminal. There is no backend server to download for this project, as all data is hosted by [this api](https://rancid-tomatillos.herokuapp.com/api/v2).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We also used (Cypress)[https://www.cypress.io/], (React Router)[https://reactrouter.com/en/main], (Figma)[https://www.figma.com/], and (Coolors)[https://coolors.co/] throughout the 10-day development.
