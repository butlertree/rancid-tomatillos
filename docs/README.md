6. The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using `npm start` in your terminal. There is no backend server to download for this project, as all data is hosted by [this api](https://rancid-tomatillos.herokuapp.com/api/v2).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We also used (Cypress)[https://www.cypress.io/], (React Router)[https://reactrouter.com/en/main], (Figma)[https://www.figma.com/], and (Coolors)[https://coolors.co/] throughout development.
